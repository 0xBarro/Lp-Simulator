# Lp Simulator

This app contains a Javascript implementation of the pricing mechanism that govern a Liquity Pools behaviour. The purpose is to provide an interactive way to obtain a better understanding of how LP's and DEXs actually work. 

This app is available at: https://0xbarro.github.io/Lp-Simulator/

# Javasript CDN 

The main Javascript file can be obtained via a CDN though here: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/0xBarro/Lp-Simulator/lp.js. This might be usefull if you want to use any of the functions in there.
